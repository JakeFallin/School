DuckWalk: Google Maps but for stevens campus. 
Gives directions to various buildings on campus and how long it will take for an “average human” to walk there. 
Has information on whether a building/restaurant is open or closed by the time you get there. 
Possibly adding functionality for multiple buildings and calculates the best route between them. 

Duck Drive: Allow users to upload files to the cloud so that they can be downloaded from other computers. 
Good for backups, and sharing files with teammates. Shows a GUI of the file system that allows users the 
rename and examine files. Users should also be able to edit basic text files via this GUI 

Duckpress: Inspired by the great Wordpress catastrophe of ‘18 this semester, 
the students will create an alternative to Wordpress called Duckpress. 
It will allow for the easy creation of basic, blog-style websites. 
It will generate basic HTML, CSS, JS, and MYSQL files. 
It should eliminate issues caused by Wordpress such as forcing users to utilize unwieldy plugins.

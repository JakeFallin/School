1. We are using p_thread_mutex when a untensil is being used. This is so that not every
philosopher can reach for a utensil, it will lock others out as a philosopher reaches for a fork.

2. We used a pthread condition varible, a lock, and a count. We started the count at 4 and decrement
it everytime someone tries to eat. When it reaches 0 it will lock philosophers from trying to eat.
We did this by using a condition varible to indicate locked status. This means that only 4 philosophers
can eat at a time. After they eat it will increment the count and unlock the threads using a condition varible.
